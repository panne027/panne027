Hi, I'm Harish Panneer Selvam, a Graduate Research Assistant and a Master's student in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from IIT Madras, India. Most of my undergraduate years were spent on the Formula SAE racecar team called Raftar Formula Racing, where I built three racecars ground up.

My current interests and projects are in the hybrid research space of data science and mechanical engineering. My work during my master's degree include using physics-informed interpretable artificial intelligence models in automotive applications like vehicle emissions and EV battery available energy predictions from vehicle onboard diagnostics data. I'm also investigating deep learning techniques to solve differential equations that govern real-world engineering systems.

I'm looking to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects that hope to bridge the gap between engineering and data science.
